# GLaRA: Graph-based Labeling Rule Augmentation for Weakly Supervised Named Entity Recognition

This paper is the code release of the paper [GLaRA: Graph-based Labeling Rule Augmentation for Weakly Supervised Named Entity Recognition] (https://github.com/zhaoxy92/GLaRA), which is accepted at EACL-2021.

This work aims at improving weakly supervised named entity reconigtion systems by automatically finding new rules that are helpful at identifying entities from data. The overall workflow is illustrated as below:
